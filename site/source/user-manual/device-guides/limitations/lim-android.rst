----------
Android versions below 12 do not have native support for :ref:`mDNS<mdns>` and therefore cannot resolve ".local" addresses.

Custom ROMs such as GrapheneOS and Calyx have been updated to use versions 12 or higher and so work as expected.

------------------------
There seems to be a bug in Lineage that makes using Firefox over Tor currently unusable. Currently, this feature works fine on Calyx and Graphene.
