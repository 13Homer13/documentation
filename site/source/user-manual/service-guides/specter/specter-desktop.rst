Specter Desktop
===============

Please follow this guide if you would like to connect `Specter Desktop <https://specter.solutions/downloads/>`_ running on your laptop/desktop (**not** your Start9 server!) to your bitcoin node or Electrs service on your Start9 server.

.. note:: This is not the same as running :ref:`Specter as a service <specter-service>` on your server. However, if you want to use Specter as a service and wish to use a USB connected hardware wallet/signing device with it, you will need to install Specter Desktop but you can ignore this guide. Please see :ref:`here instead<specter-service>`.

#. Start by ensuring that Tor is running on your system as Specter will connect to Bitcoin or Electrs via the Tor network. For instructions on how to do this see :ref:`here<tor-os>` and slecet the approriate operating system.

#. Once Tor is up and running go ahead and install `Specter Desktop <https://specter.solutions/downloads/>`_.
