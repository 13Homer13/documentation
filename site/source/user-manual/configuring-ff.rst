===================
Configuring Firefox 
===================
Firefox is the only browser that can be configured to access both LAN (`.local`) and Tor (`.onion`) URLs, including extensions, without affecting normal browser functionality. We highly recommend using Firefox for connecting to your server and its installed services.

.. note:: For iOS, we recommend using Safari instead of Firefox. That is because on iOS, all browsers must use Safari under the hood, so it is preferable not to stack unnecessary software on top of it.

Select your OS:

- :ref:`Linux <ff-linux>`
- :ref:`Mac <ff-mac>`
- :ref:`Windows <ff-windows>`
- :ref:`Android (Firefox Beta) <ff-android>`
