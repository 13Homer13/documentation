===================
Connecting Remotely
===================
You can connect to your server and installed services from anywhere in the world, privately and anonymously, by using their unique Tor (`.onion`) URLs

.. note:: It is normal for Tor connections to be slow or unreliable at times

Running Tor on Your Phone/Computer (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------
Select your OS:

- :ref:`Linux <tor-linux>`
- :ref:`Mac <tor-mac>`
- :ref:`Windows <tor-windows>`
- :ref:`Android <tor-android>`
- :ref:`iOS <tor-ios>`

Using Firefox (recommended)
------------------------------
#. Complete the "Tor" portion for your OS. Use Safari for iOS

- :ref:`Linux <ff-linux>`
- :ref:`Mac <ff-mac>`
- :ref:`Windows <ff-windows>`
- :ref:`Android <ff-android>`

Using the Tor Browser
---------------------
Using the official Tor Browser allows you to access `.onion` URLs without additional configuration. However, accessing clearnet (`.com`, `.org`, ect) websites will also be routed over Tor, making them slower, and `.local` URLs cannot be accessed at all.

Linux, Mac, Windows, Android
