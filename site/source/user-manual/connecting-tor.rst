  Running Tor on iOS

Using a Tor Browser
-------------------
Using the official Tor Browser allows you to access `.onion` URLs without additional configuration. However, accessing clearnet (`.com`, `.org`, ect) websites will also be routed over Tor, making them slower, and `.local` URLs cannot be accessed at all.

Linux, Mac, Windows, Android

iOS

iOS lacks a well-functioning Tor Browser.
