Hardware
--------
With x86 support, embassyOS can now be run on a very wide array of hardware.  You can even try out or run eOS in a Virtual Machine (VM) without having to buy any hardware whatsoever!  Check out `this forum post <https://community.start9.com/t/known-good-hardware-master-list-hardware-capable-of-running-embassyos-v0-3-3/>`_ for the most up-to-date list of known-good hardware.

.. _os-reqs:

.. note:: embassyOS is based on Linux, and on its own, is fairly lightweight.  The hardware you require will depend mostly on how you intend to use your Embassy.  If you intend to use a Bitcoin stack, you will want at least 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.  If you mostly intend to use your server to store and manage files/passwords, then RAM will be less important and storage will depend on your needs.  Check the current size of your existing storage solution (such as Dropbox or iCloud) to get an idea what you will require.

Minimum OS Requirements
.......................
- Single vCPU Core 2Ghz
- 4GB RAM
- 64GB Storage

Recommended OS Requirements
...........................
- Quad-Core CPU 2.5Ghz+
- 8GB+ RAM
- 1TB+ Storage

Flash and Install embassyOS
