Here you will find guidelines for building your own Start9 server!  Currently, StartOS is known to work well on the Raspberry Pi and on **most** x86_64 platforms (desktops, laptops, mini PCs, servers, and virtual machines).  ARM builds are also available, but are relatively untested.

Motivation
----------
There are several reasons you might prefer to build your own server instead of purchasing one from Start9:

    #. You already own the necessary hardware and would like to re-purpose it.
    #. You want to save on shipping or import costs to your location.
    #. You do not trust Start9's supply chain.
    #. You do not want to share your shipping address.
    #. You like building things.
