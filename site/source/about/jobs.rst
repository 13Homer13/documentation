About Start9
------------

Our mission at Start9 is to eliminate the need for trusted 3rd parties in the human/computer relationship. Our flagship product, EmbassyOS, is the most advanced, secure, and reliable personal server operating system in the world, making it possible for anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to run their own server. One brick at a time, we will help construct an open and decentralized computing platform for humanity's future, one where sovereign individuals control their own data and the flow of information, as well as the abundance of intelligent devices that will come to engulf the human experience.
