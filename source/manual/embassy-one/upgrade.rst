Upgrading
=========

Embassy OS
----------
Visit the Embassy tab from the Dashboard menu. Select “Check for Upgrades”. Clicking this will reach out to the marketplace to see if a new OS update has been released, and will indicate if it has. You can then update and get access to new features and bug fixes. 

Services
--------
Visit the Marketplace tab from the Dashboard menu. Each service will denote a status, such as:

* Not Installed
* Installed
* Update Available

If Update Available is denoted as the option, select the service you are interested in updating, and click the green update button on the service page in the Marketplace.

Config
^^^^^^
These are configuration options that can be changed at any time. When a service is in `Needs Config` status, it requires user input to complete setup before the service can be started. 

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^
These are user initiated configuration properties, typically for credentials such as a password.
