    Add WiFi Network options

#. Select the appropriate country to ensure the proper protocol is used.
#. Click `Add and Connect`. 
#. The saved network will appear in the list when successfully added. At this point, you can disconnect the Embassy from your router.

If the Embassy relocates or needs to change WiFi networks, it can be connected into the new routerâ€™s ethernet jack and powered on to complete this process again.

.. note::
    The network speeds (and other server metrics) can be monitored within the Embassy dashboard.
