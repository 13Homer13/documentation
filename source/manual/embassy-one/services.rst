Installing services
===================

Visit the marketplace from the Embassy dashboard menu. Select a service to download. When the service has finished installing, a notification will appear when complete. 

Services can be viewed in the Services tab in the dashboard menu. Selecting a service here allows you to:

#. View the instructions:

   * Details on what the service is and how to use it. Any gotchas, special options, or gaps in functionality are noted here.

#. Supply configuration options:

   * Some services require input to configure the service before running. This could be entering a password, enabling certain features, or confirming the default options.

#. Run the service:

   * A service will not be started when downloaded. This will need to be user initiated. Once a service has been configured, the option to start the service will appear. After it is started, the service is available for you to use.
