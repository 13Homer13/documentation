Exploring Services in Marketplace
---------------------------------

The Start9 Marketplace currently hosts the available service to install on your Embassy. Soon, any developer will be able to submit a service to this marketplace for review. Submitted services will follow our :ref:`sdk` Guide to conform to the standards necessary for Embassy software services to run.

The review will consist of code review (we want services to work very well), user experience testing acceptance (we want services to be a dead simple and pleasant experience), documentation of instructions (we want it to be clear to users and developers how to run and contribute), and a security vulnerability audit (we want to prevent any malware being installed).
