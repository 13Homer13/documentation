Unboxing the Embassy
====================

We have strived to create a “batteries included” product, so the box you receive includes all necessary components to run and backup your Embassy. The included brochure diagram demonstrates how to plug in the device for initial setup. Scanning the brochure QR code will redirect to the setup instructions for your Embassy OS version. 

The included USB stick can be used for service backups right out of the box. Simply plug it into the Embassy and navigate to the desired service you want to back up from the `Services` tab in the dashboard menu.
